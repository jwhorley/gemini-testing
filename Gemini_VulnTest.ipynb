This system uses a variety of machine learning models to identify and remove harmful content from our platform.\\n\\nThe content moderation system is trained on a large dataset of text and images. The dataset includes examples of harmful content, such as hate speech, violence, and pornography. The models are able to identify harmful content with a high degree of accuracy.\\n\\nWhen a user submits a query, the content moderation system checks the query against the dataset of harmful content. If the query is found to be harmful, the system will set the `denylist_status` to `BLOCKED`.\\n\\nThe content moderation system is constantly being updated and improved. As the system improves, we are able to identify and remove more harmful content from our platform.\\n\\nIn addition to the content moderation system, we also have a team of human reviewers who manually review content that has been flagged by the system. The human reviewers can override the system\\'s decision and set the `denylist_status` to `ALLOWED` if they believe that the content is not harmful.\\n\\nWe are committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for our users. We will continue to invest in our content moderation system and team of human reviewers to ensure that harmful content is removed from our platform.\\n\\nI hope this explanation is helpful.\"\n",
